<h1>
    Introduction to CSS
</h1>
<p>
    Let's learn about CSS!
</p>
<h1>
    Changing the color and size of h1 elements
</h1>
<p>
    In style.css, we are using the selector h1 to select all h1 elements. We use the color and size properties to specify the color and size we want for these elements.
</p>
<!--This is controlled by the ID Selector in css-->
<ol>
    <li id="vvip">Very very important!</li>
</ol>
<!--This is controlled by the Class Selector in css-->
<nav class="navigation">
    This text will be in font-size 16pt because of the above rule.
</nav>
<!--So when should use classes vs. IDs as selectors in our rules? Consider the following:
In a single page, an ID can be used only be one element, whereas a class can be reused by multiple elements
Thus, IDs are good for anchoring and specifying unique blocks, whereas classes are more about design properties
that get used again and again.-->
</body>
</html>

<!-- Three ways to add Styles to an HTML document-->
<!--
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />   // This is #1.  External, can be shared by multiple pages
  <style type="text/css">  // This is #2 - Internal, css style specific to that webpage / section
    body{
      font-family: Tahoma;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p style="font-size:20pt">  // This is #3 - Inline, applies to that section only
    This is size 20.
  </p>
  This is the default size.
</body>
-->

<!--
Precedence:
Inline (#3) wins
Internal (#2) overrides External
External (#3) is applied at load, then everything else takes over

Rules with a more specific selector take precedence over those with more general selectors. For example
p is more specific than *.
p em is more specific than p.
Rules associated with id override rules associated with class.
Rules associated with class override rules associated with tags.

keep the styling rules as simple as possible:

Try to use a single .css file.
Do not use inline styles.

Colors
    Hex - form #RRGGBB
    Decimal - form rgb(x, y, z)
    Named - red, green, blue etc (more limited than the above two
-->

<!--Length Units-->
<!--
Absolute
    cm, in, pt (points = 1pt = 1/72 of an inch), px (pixels = 1px = 1/96th of an inch,
                                                        browsers may ignore and use display resolution instead
Relative
    Relative units allow the size of an element or the distance between elements to scale relative to other
        elements on the screen

    Most commonly used are em and rem
    em - is a relative unit based on the current font size of the parent element.  (emulate?)
    rem - is a relative unit based on the current font size of the root element    (root emulate?)
-->

<!--Box Model-->
<!--
CSS treats each HTML element as if it were its own self contained box.
There are two box types - block level and inline
Elements such as h1, p, ul, li are block-level elements and start on a new line,
    whereas elements such as img, b, i are inline elements and do not start a new line.

The most important properties to control the sizing of the box are (from top/outside to middle/inner):
    Margin
    Border
    Padding
    Height / Width

Size Properties in the Box Model

Element.
    We can specify width and height properties to override element defaults.
Padding.
    We can specify the size of the padding using the properties padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left.
Margin.
    We can specify the size of the margin using the properties maring-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left.
Border.
    We can specify the color, style, and width of the border at the top, bottom, left, and right,
        using 12 different properties.
    The names of the properties for controlling the border at the top are border-top-color,
        border-top-style and border-top-width.
    The names of the properties corresponding to the border at the bottom have the word bottom instead of top
        in their names.
    Similarly, replace top by left or right for properties corresponding to the border on the left
        or the one on the right.

Note:
Typically the sizes of the padding are declared using one of many abbreviated forms. For example:
The declaration
    padding: 10px;
means that all 4 padding sizes are 10px.
The declaration
    padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;
specifies the 4 padding sizes in the order top, right, bottom, and left.
These abbreviated forms are also used for margin and border.

<!--Positioning-->
<!-- See position_examples.html and position_examples.css-->

<!--DOM (Document Object Model) -->
<!--
The DOM is the model that a browser uses to render a web page. As a first step to rendering a page, the browser parses
the HTML document and creates a DOM tree from it. From there the browser renders the page by rendering each node of the
DOM tree. The DOM gives a representation of a document as a logical tree of nodes and includes an API for interacting
with this tree representation. This allows us to write programs to dynamically access and modify the content, structure,
and style of an HTML document.
-->
<!--Trees-->
<!--
A tree is made up of nodes. Each node has exactly one parent (with one exception noted below). However, a node can have
    an unlimited number of children.
If a node has no children it is called a leaf. Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings.
In an HTML DOM tree, the order of the siblings is significant as it determines which gets rendered first
    (and thus usually higher) in the page.
-->

<!--
Another important property of trees is that a tree cannot have cycles. This means that:

If we are at a node X and we navigate up the tree to X’s parent, and then to X’s parent’s parent, and so on,
    we will never arrive back to X. Our navigation will stop at the root node.
If we are at a node X and we navigate down the tree of any one X’s children, then keep navigating down the tree to any
one of that node’s children, and so on, we will never arrive back at X. Our navigation will stop at a leaf node.
-->

<!--Javascript and DOM-->
<!--
When JavaScript is running in the browser, two global objects window and document are available to the JavaScript code.
The object window represents the browser window and the object document represents the webpage currently loaded in this
browser window. The object document gives us an entry point into the DOM tree that the browser has built up after it
parsed the webpage. document is also available as a property of window, i.e., window.document.
The properties document.head and document.body respectively correspond to the head and body element of the document.
