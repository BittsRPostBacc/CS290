/**
 * Exploration â€” State & React Hooks
 *
 * In this exploration, we will study state variables and their use in React applications. State variables in a React
 * application hold data that when changed can cause the DOM tree displayed in the browser to be updated.
 * In fact, when writing React applications, we do not write code to directly update the DOM tree.
 * Instead, we change the value of state variables and the React framework then makes the needed changes to the DOM.
 * React applications use state for many things, including the following:
 *
 * Giving visual feedback based on user actions. Examples include:
 * Showing and hiding items in a shopping cart.
 * Changing the icon when a bookmark is added or removed from an item.
 * Modifying a selected menu item.
 * Updating the page based on data retrieval, for example, from a file, from a database, or from a web service.
 * Updating the page based on a timer.
