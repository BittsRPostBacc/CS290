/**
 * Exploration â€” Routing & Forms
 *
 * In this exploration, we will study how to write Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the React Router.
 * A second topic we will study is how to build forms in React apps.
 *
 * A major use for React is building SPAs. Recall that with SPAs the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a web app are sent
 * from the server to the browser exactly once. After that when the user navigates to another page in the app,
 * the client-side code makes changes to the DOM so that the user feels that a new page has been loaded in the browser.
 * When writing React apps, we can use the React Router library to create SPAs. React Router supports defining routes
 * in our React app, i.e., we can define how to map URLs to resources. When the user clicks a link in the app,
 * the React app already loaded in the browser uses the React Router library to map this request to a new component
 * and renders a different DOM tree completely within the browser, without sending the request to a server.
